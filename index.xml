      <description>TL;DR Project concerned with generating political speech coherent with the styles of renowned world leaders through Deep Learning models and Large Language models and assessing their accuracy in producing new content that keeps in line with the vocabulary, style and tone of the political figure chosen. Data science is used to create visualizations on the generated text comparing it to the original text. Here&amp;rsquo;s a funny meme from the Orange County Register that is in line with what the project tries to assess!</description>

      <description>üéáüë©‚ÄçüíªMy GHC experience!!üë©‚Äçüíªüéá üåü I was thrilled to be a part of the Boston University cohort for GHC attendees in person this year and the conference lived upto its name indeed! Surrounded by empowering and intelligent women and non-binary folk in Tech really gave me a new surge of energy and determination in making the most out of GHC this year. The career fair and expo of GHC was the main highlight of the conference for me, as the sheer scale of it was enough to intimidate anyone.</description>

      <description>TL;DR Project concerned with creating an evaluation metric for assessing originality of texts produced by AI models, human written texts or a combination of both. The pipeline follows sample data being classified in various ways as AI-written or Human-written by different detector models and combining their scores as per calculated weights to obtain insights into whether the text was truly &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo;.
Motivation The advent of Large Language Models and Neural Networks to generate human-like texts and responses has made a lasting impact on how AI will play a considerable role in automating several corporate and academic environments.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Conversational App Integration with the Core Product Using Technology. This was the topic statement we had to come up with a fully functioning website for that satisified the core objectives of the 2 day long hackathon.
Our train of thought! Approach Our aim was to code a voice assistant that accepts a voice input, and outputs the required result after searching the vast Dell Digital database. To facilitate speech recognition and synthesis, we used the HTML5 Speech Recognition API.</description>

      <description>Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Smriti Suresh, a 23 year old aspiring Data Scientist, and I am ecstatic to share that I very recently successfully obtained my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science at Boston University. I am passionate about Natural Language Processing and all things data. After obtaining my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering from Mahindra Ecole Centrale (now Mahindra University) in Hyderabad, India, I knew I wanted to delve into the intricacies of how natural language and computing combine to produce mind-boggling results (GenAI is insane right now :o).</description>
