      <description>🎇👩‍💻My GHC experience!!👩‍💻🎇 🌟 I was thrilled to be a part of the Boston University cohort for GHC attendees in person this year and the conference lived upto its name indeed! Surrounded by empowering and intelligent women and non-binary folk in Tech really gave me a new surge of energy and determination in making the most out of GHC this year. The career fair and expo of GHC was the main highlight of the conference for me, as the sheer scale of it was enough to intimidate anyone.</description>
