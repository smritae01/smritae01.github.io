      <description>TL;DR Project concerned with generating political speech coherent with the styles of renowned world leaders through Deep Learning models and Large Language models and assessing their accuracy in producing new content that keeps in line with the vocabulary, style and tone of the political figure chosen. Data science is used to create visualizations on the generated text comparing it to the original text. Here&amp;rsquo;s a funny meme from the Orange County Register that is in line with what the project tries to assess!</description>

      <description>TL;DR Project concerned with Herbaria OCR techniques to extract all text from a given image to display the specimen information in the desired DarwinCore format for accomplishing the larger goal of preservation of early 19th century species through digitization. Machine learning pipeline using AI Vision models as well as text processing through GPT-4 along with evaluation of the training data was done successfully, culminating in deployment and a poster presentation to the BU Spark!</description>
