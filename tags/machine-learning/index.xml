      <description>The Project Employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to be modelled after the political personalities that govern our societies may not be a distant dream after all. The aim of the project was to create a system that generates political speeches, and figured out what the topics of focus were, for each of these generated speeches.
The idea was to take a text generation model (in our case, we took GPT, BERT, RNNs, etc), train it with political speeches picked from multiple political figures, and finally prompt the model to generate a speech, given the input.</description>

      <description>Overview The changing climate increases stressors that weaken plant resilience, disrupting forest structure and ecosystem services. Rising temperatures lead to more frequent droughts, wildfires, and invasive pest outbreaks, leading to the loss of plant species. That has numerous detrimental effects, including lowered productivity, the spread of invasive plants, vulnerability to pests, altered ecosystem structure, etc. The project aims to aid climate scientists in capturing patterns in plant life concerning changing climate.</description>
