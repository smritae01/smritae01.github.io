      <description>The Project Employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to be modelled after the political personalities that govern our societies may not be a distant dream after all. The aim of the project was to create a system that generates political speeches, and figured out what the topics of focus were, for each of these generated speeches.
The idea was to take a text generation model (in our case, we took GPT, BERT, RNNs, etc), train it with political speeches picked from multiple political figures, and finally prompt the model to generate a speech, given the input.</description>
