      <description>Motivation It all started as a part of my third year undergrad project, we were trying to analyze the interesting discourse online about the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. Since it was the early days of this torturous pandemic, I was quite fascinated as to how people from various sections of the society coped with the day-to-day stress COVID-19 imposed over us in the form of humorous text. From this stemmed the topic of topical humor as a thesis project.</description>
