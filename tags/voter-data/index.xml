      <description>Motivation This project undertaken by the initiative of City Councillor Julia Mejia was concerned with voting patterns in the Latine/Latinx community amongst different communities of eligible voters, registered voters, voter turnout, precinct breakdown, demographic information (age and gender breakdown) and many such factors.
Our goals were: finding voting patterns within precincts and looking at gender breakdowns based on party affiliation, Show changes in eligibility, registration, and voting over time among likely LatinX voters and display voting pattern information into an interactive platform (firebase app).</description>
