      <description>TL;DR Project concerned with creating an evaluation metric for assessing originality of texts produced by AI models, human written texts or a combination of both. The pipeline follows sample data being classified in various ways as AI-written or Human-written by different detector models and combining their scores as per calculated weights to obtain insights into whether the text was truly &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo;.
Motivation The advent of Large Language Models and Neural Networks to generate human-like texts and responses has made a lasting impact on how AI will play a considerable role in automating several corporate and academic environments.</description>
